Neeko's portfolio

Found at neekode.com.

Hosted at Digital Ocean, Domain from Hover, Continuous Deployment from Netlify.

Most impressive part about this project is what i call the Ballpit Simulator. It's a fancy background for the portfolio which the user can edit and modify. 
It's all built with React Hooks, and remains as pure, functional, and modular as possible. I've actually got the Ballpit Simulator in a separate repo if you want it. 

Thanks for visiting!
